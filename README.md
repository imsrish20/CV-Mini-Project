# CV-TA

📘 Project Overview: Computer Vision Algorithms
This project contains Jupyter Notebook implementations of various classical computer vision algorithms using OpenCV and Python. The goal is to demonstrate how different corner detection and feature matching techniques work using real images.

📓 Notebooks
HARRIS.ipynb
Implementation of the Harris Corner Detection algorithm to find interest points in images based on gradient analysis.

Shi-Tomasi.ipynb
Uses the Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection (an improvement over Harris) to detect optimal features for tracking.

SIFT.ipynb
Demonstrates the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for detecting and matching keypoints across images.

🖼️ Images
